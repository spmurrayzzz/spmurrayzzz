I'm a principal-level software engineer and currently serve as Cofounder & VP of Engineering at Starry Internet, where I focus on building robust and scalable systems in the service of managing network operations. My technical expertise spans distributed systems, AI/ML, networking, and operations tooling.

At Starry, I've contributed across multiple domains: developing cloud services for incident and alarm management, building and maintaining IPAM/DCIM services for internal network infrastructure, managing large-scale telemetry ingestion, and applying machine learning to enhance developer tooling and data analysis.

Previously, I worked with the same team at Aereo on a live OTA television streaming service.
